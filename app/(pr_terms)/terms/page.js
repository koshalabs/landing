                <BoldSpan>Arbitration.</BoldSpan> These Terms and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act applies in all cases and governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. Any Covered Matters must be asserted individually in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Terms and the AAA Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (including, without limitation, utilizing desk, phone, or video conference proceedings where appropriate and permitted to mitigate costs of travel). The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of className or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable or a particular claim is subject to arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </Separator>
            <Separator>
                <BoldSpan>Award.</BoldSpan> For matters where the relief sought is over $5,000, the arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Kosha Labs user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.
            </Separator>
            <Separator>
                    <BoldSpan>Exceptions.</BoldSpan> There are only two exceptions to this arbitration agreement:
                    <br/><br/>
                    First, if a party reasonably believes that the other party has in any manner infringed or threatened to infringe the intellectual property rights of the other party, the party who owns the intellectual property rights may seek injunctive or other appropriate interim relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Second, any claim of $500 or less may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court within the United States, if the claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of the small claims court and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-className, non-representative) basis.
            </Separator>
            <Separator>
                <BoldSpan>Costs of Arbitration.</BoldSpan> Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $5,000 or less, at your request, Kosha Labs will reimburse you for all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration following the earlier of the arbitrator’s decision or settlement. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, Kosha Labs is relieved of its obligation to reimburse you for any fees associated with the arbitration.
            </Separator>
            <Separator>
                <BoldSpan>Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</BoldSpan> Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitrate in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Kosha Labs prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the agreement to arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and Kosha Labs. If you do not agree to these amended terms, you may close your account within thirty (30) days of the posting or notification and you will not be bound by the amended terms.
            </Separator>
            <Separator>
                <BoldSpan>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes.</BoldSpan> Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, either as a result of your decision to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, or because you have chosen to file an eligible lawsuit in small claims court, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Kosha Labs must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Wyoming. You and Kosha Labs agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Wyoming for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

IF YOU ARE A NEW USER, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE PROVISION ("OPT-OUT") BY EMAILING US AN OPT-OUT NOTICE TO info@theKosha Labs.io ("OPT-OUT NOTICE"): Kosha Labs.

            </Separator>
